Dear Friend,

What a pleasure it is to see the Charter Committee of Greater Cincinnati on its feet and going strong, fulfilling the promise of promoting good government in Cincinnati. This letter is by way of delivering my wholehearted endorsement of all five candidates who have chosen to affiliate with the Charter organization. It is, in true Charter fashion, a multipartisan and diverse group:

* Laketa Cole made history as the first and youngest African-American woman appointed 
to City Council in 2003, later serving on the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio; she currently is vice president of Bond Hill Community Council and she is a graduate of Aiken High School.
* Don Driehaus has 30 years of experience in finance and service on boards including the Cincinnati Metropolitan Housing Authority, Bethany House, and the West Price Hill Community Council.
* Steve Goodin, a former Cincinnati City Council member, has led the Charter Committee of Greater Cincinnati in the past two years.  He is a partner at Porter Wright Morris & Arthur and serves on the Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission, USO Ohio Board, and Clifton Town Meeting.
* Dawn Johnson is a wife, mom, doula, small business owner, and community leader who is president of the North Avondale Neighborhood Association.
* Aaron Weiner, a fourth-generation Cincinnatian and longtime realtor, serves on the Boards of the Jewish Community Center and Jewish Federation of Cincinnati, and has led initiatives like the Clifton Home and Garden Tour and Cliftonfest.

These are the people to vote for in the general election November 4. Get to know these candidates and you will see that they are all committed to hearing the voices of the community. 
City Council is ripe for a new direction; the incumbents voted for the Hyde Park zoning change–thankfully withdrawn after the people spoke–among other things, without listening to the community. We need to be done with that approach.

If you are reading this, you probably know I’ve been involved in local politics as a Charterite for decades. I love Cincinnati, and I can’t look at any part of Cincinnati without wondering at what this city has done thus far, and imagining what the future could hold. I know many of you feel the same way. 

It’s not always fun to think about politics; sometimes it can be downright discouraging. But you have to remember that your vote is your voice–that is how democracy works. Recently I have been at a number of gatherings of people who care about each other and who care about Cincinnati, and the energy I have felt in these gatherings is immense, and real, and oriented toward the future. That’s what gives me hope.

Join me in sending all of the Charter candidates to City Council in November. We will achieve a new day for good government in Cincinnati.   

Sincerely,

Jim Tarbell
